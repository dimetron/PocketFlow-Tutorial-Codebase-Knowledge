# Tutorial: tracecat

Tracecat is a platform for automating responses to security incidents or IT tickets.
You create a **Workflow**, which is like a step-by-step *recipe*, using a library of pre-built **Actions** (e.g., sending a Slack message).
When a new **Case** (an alert or ticket) is created, the *Execution Engine* runs the appropriate workflow to handle it automatically.
The platform also includes a smart **AI Agent** that can intelligently choose which actions to use to investigate and resolve cases.

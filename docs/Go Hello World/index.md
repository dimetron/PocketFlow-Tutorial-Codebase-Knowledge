# Tutorial: test

This is a **basic "Hello, World!" program** written in Go, demonstrating the fundamental structure of a Go application. The program showcases how Go organizes code through *packages*, brings in external functionality via *imports*, and communicates with the user through **console output**. It's an excellent starting point for understanding how Go programs are structured and executed.

# Tutorial: adk-python

This project is a framework for building applications powered by *artificial intelligence*, known as the Agent Development Kit (ADK). Think of it like creating a team of specialized AI workers, called **Agents**. You can give these agents *instructions*, equip them with **Tools** (like searching the web or accessing a database), and have them collaborate in complex **Workflows**. The entire operation is managed by a **Runner**, which orchestrates the agents to fulfill a user's request, keeping track of the entire conversation in a **Session**. This allows you to build anything from a simple chatbot to a sophisticated, multi-agent system that can solve real-world problems.

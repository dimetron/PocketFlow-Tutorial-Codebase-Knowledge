# Tutorial: goose

**Goose** is an **AI agent platform** that enables users to automate complex workflows through a conversational interface. It combines a **real-time chat UI**, a **job scheduling engine** (powered by Temporal.io), and **recipe-based automation** to allow AI agents to execute multi-step tasks, access external tools via **MCP servers**, and manage long-running background jobs. The system includes a **desktop application**, **web interface**, **benchmark evaluation pipeline**, and security training for detecting malicious recipes.
